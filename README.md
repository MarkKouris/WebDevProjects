# WebDevProjects
This repository contains 3 projects I have done using HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br />
The first is a sample login page, with mobile devices in mind. <br />
The second is an example multi-step form, where the user can input data at each stage. <br />
The third is some funky programmer art I made of some spinning squares, since I'm a rendering engineer at heart. <br />
